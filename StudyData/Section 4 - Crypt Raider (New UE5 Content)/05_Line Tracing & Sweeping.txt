01. Line Trace

Start ● -------- Triangle ----- Square ----- Rect -------- ● End

What we might do is take a starting point and an ending point and essentially trace a line through from the start to the end and 
see what that line overlaps with.

So when you do line trace, you essentially can get back either a result, which is all of the objects 
that the line intersected with on its path to the end.

Or you can just get the first object that it hit and some optimizations that mean that if it hits an objects, it actually doesn't do the
entire trace at all.

So this is how we often do things like shooting guns in first person shooters or even like we're doing here, picking up objects.

There's an alternative to the line trace, however, because the line trace can mean that we have to be extremely accurate.
If we miss an object by a few millimeters like this sphere, it won't picked up.

02. Shape Trace

         -----------------------------------------------
Start ●          Triangle      Square      Rect          ● End
         -----------------------------------------------

So the alternative is a shape trace and sometimes more specifically known as a sphere trace.

If that's the shape we're using or more generally it's actually known in code as a gemoetry trace.

What we do here is we take a sphere starting at our starting point, and as we as name would suggest, we trace it or we sweep it,
actually, we sweep the sphere through the world to the end point.

And if it intersected with anything along the way, then that is something that the trace will hit.

So for example, we will overlap here with this triangle and the sphere because we've expanded the radius of the search space.



Now there's one more additional thing that we can add to our traces to make them ignore certain shapes in the scene.

Because, for example, we know that we can't grab hold of this wall and maybe we want to able to grab something through the bars,
even though we might be hitting the bars as we do so.

03. Trace Channel

         ------------------------------------------------
Start ●          Triangle      Square      (Rect)          ● End
         ------------------------------------------------

The way to do that is using something calle the Trace Channel, and this essentially creates a list of objects that can respond to the Trace
and others will that might want to ignore it entirely.

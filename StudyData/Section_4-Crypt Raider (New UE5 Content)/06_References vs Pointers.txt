Comparing Pointers to References
                                 Pointers                    References
What is stored                       Memory address
Can be re-assigned       Yes                          No
(to another address)
Can be null                  Yes(use nullptr)          No, must be initialised
Accessing contents       *ActorPtr                   ActorRef
Accessing address         ActorPtr                   &ActorRef
Changing the address    ActorPtr = &Actor      Not allowed
Changing the value       *ActorPtr = Actor       ActorRef = Actor

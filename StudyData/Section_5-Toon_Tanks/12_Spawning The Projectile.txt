Spawning the Projectile

● Spawn from C++
● Based on the Blueprintclass

How do we spawn an object in C++, which is based on a blueprint?

TSubclassOf

TSubclassOf<> TSubclassOf<Type>
● Template
● Requires a type parameter
● Stores a UClass
   ○ Subclass of the chosen type
   ○ Even Blueprints based on the type

Spawning Actors

UWorld::SpawnActor

SpawnActor<>() -> SpawnActor<Type>() <- UClass, Location, Rotation
● SpawnActor is another template function and it's desinged to create new objects similar to create defualt sub object
● But create default sub object is designed for creating components and we can only use it in the constructor for a paricular class 
    spawn actor can be called at runtime while the game is running and it can create actors.

SpawnActor<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, Loc, Rot)
   ○ UClass* : Class what represents the type to spawn. Actual type of the object that gets spawned. This could be a blueprint class.
   ○ FVector : The location is an F vector specifying where to spawn the object and the rotation will specify its rotation.
   ○ FRotator
